Bank Management System 🏦
A comprehensive C++ project designed to manage banking operations through three distinct development phases. This system handles multiple user roles including Clients, Employees, and Admins.

🚀 Project Overview
The system is built with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, featuring inheritance (Person -> Client/Employee -> Admin) and a structured data management system using file handling.

Key Modules:
Client Module: Handling login, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
Employee Module: Managing client accounts and personal info.
Admin Module: Full control over employees and system data.
📅 Development Roadmap
✅ Phase 1: Core Foundation (Data Modeling)
Focus: Creating the basic class structure and validation logic.

 Person Class: Base class for all users (ID, Name, Password).
 Client Class: Includes balance, deposit, withdraw, and transfer functions.
 Employee & Admin Classes: Managing salaries and specific permissions.
 Validation Class: Static methods for name length (5-20 chars) and password (8-20 chars).
⏳ Phase 2: Data Persistence (File Management)
Focus: Managing data using text files and abstract interfaces.

 File Storage: Implementing Clients.txt, Employee.txt, and Admin.txt.
 Parser Class: Handling string splitting and object conversion.
 FileManager Class: Implementing the DataSourceInterface for full CRUD operations on files.
 Advanced Logic: Adding search and edit capabilities for clients and employees.
🔜 Phase 3: Application Logic & UI (Presentation)
Focus: Building the user menus and application flow.

 Manager Classes: Implementing ClientManager, EmployeeManager, and AdminManager logic.
 Screen System: Creating a static Screens class for navigation and login options.
 App Runner: Implementing the final runApp() to glue all systems together.
